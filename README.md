Customer Viewing Behaviour Analysis

Description:
This project analyzes customer viewing behavior using machine learning and statistical techniques. It focuses on preprocessing, visualization, and modeling to extract patterns, identify clusters, and predict outcomes based on customer data.

Key Features:
- Data Visualization: Static (Seaborn, Matplotlib) and interactive (Plotly) visualizations for insightful analysis.
- Preprocessing: Standard scaling, label encoding, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- Models Used:
  - Classification, Regression: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
  - Clustering: Agglomerative Clustering
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
